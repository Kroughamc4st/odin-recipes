        <p>It takes a little work, but it is worth it.</p>
            <h4 class="subsub">Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground lamb, or beef</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup minced red onion</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
                    <li>Oil, for grilling or frying, as needed</li>
                    <li>4 rounds flatbread, or pita</li>
                    <li>4 leaves lettuce</li>
                    <li>1 medium tomato, sliced or diced</li>
                    <li>1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup Tzatziki sauce</li>
                </ul>
             <h4 class="subsub">Steps</h4>
                 <ol>
                    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>                 
                    <li>
                        To make the meat mixture, thoroughly combine the ground lamb, 
                        salt, black pepper, cumin, nutmeg, oregano, garlic, red onion, 
                        and lemon juice in a mixing bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Divide into four equal portions and shape into oblong patties 
                        about 3-inch wide by 6-inch long by 1/2-inch thick. Notice that 
                        the patty is shaped more like a sausage (long and thin) 
                        rather than a hamburger patty. This is intentional, 
                        to ensure the patty fits in the flatbread. Refrigerate for one hour.    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Alternatively, 
                        heat a large nonstick skillet over high heat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If grilling, brush the grill or grill pan with oil. If pan-frying, 
                        add a dollop of oil to the pan. Grill or pan-fry the patties 
                        for 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until cooked through with crispy edges.
                    </li> 
                    <li>To assemble the sandwiches, spread tzatziki sauce down in the center 
                        of a flatbread round or the pocket of the pita.
                    </li>   
                    <li>
                        Add a lettuce leaf, some sliced tomato, and a few thin onion slices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the patty and fold the bread over the lamb. 
                        Repeat with the remaining sandwiches. Serve and enjoy.
                    </li>
                 </ol>
